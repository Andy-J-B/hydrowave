# Welcome to my Expo app ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Bae, a second year Computer Science student at SFU. This is a application built for my friend's business that will be launched on the google play store.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
